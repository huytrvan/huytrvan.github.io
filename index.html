            It is predicted that remote work will become increasingly important in the coming decades, based on <a

            Unfortunately, the benefits of remote work, as of now, could only be applied to mostly white-collar jobs.

        <p class="content__paragraph">This means certain mission-critical professions that need physical presence such
            as
            on-site engineers and medical staffs are lacking the ability to work remotely. Sometimes, this could expose
            them
            to potential health risks, an example is <a

            At Beemo Robotics, we aim to close this gap by providing humanoid remote-work robots to serve these
            particular
            usecases. We believe it would greatly improve safety for employees and increase flexibility as well
            convenience
            for companies due to the fact that jobs are
            not bounded
            by geography.
